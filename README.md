# Ghostless Pacman
An implementation of Pacman (without the ghosts) in C!

## Gameplay

## Requirements
The game only runs on Windows currently.

## Running the Game
To build and run the code from source, follow the following steps:
1. Download the source of the game by cloning this repository or by downloading it as ZIP file and extracting it to your preffered directory.
2. Head inside the cloned/extracted folder and run the **"run.bat"** file. The batch file will execute the following commands inside the directory:
```batch
gcc main.c -o main

./main
``` 

## Known Bugs
Weirdly enough, F7 is moves the character to the left and F10 moves the character to the right. Pressing the right arrow key also pauses the game.
